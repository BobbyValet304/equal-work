# equal-work

My motivation for this Task board is to provide a way to organize and your tasks in an ordered manner that allows you to accomplish each one by the given due date.
I built this project because I personally understand that there are so many tasks to get done every week and hardly any time. If a person is not efficient with planning and organizing the time that the dedicate to each task it is easy to end up with several tasks on your plate at the same time.
This task board fixes the problem of having all of your tasks and due dates in different places by grouping everything together into a single task board. The color coding helps one to recognize what is the most important task to complete at the moment. Then you can move it into the In Progress column so that if you don't finish, you'll know what task you were on. Finally you can drag it over to the done column for when you have finished it, and when you have cluttered your task board then you can delete done tasks to make more room.
I learned quite a bit about Jquery, Dayjs, Chrome DevTools, and the debugging process in general. There is nothing more important to a developer than the debugging process.
My project stands out due to the efficiency with which you can update your board and organize your tasks.
